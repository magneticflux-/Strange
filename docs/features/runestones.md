# Runestones

![Collection of different runestones](https://i.postimg.cc/gk1pXt3x/Runestones.jpg)

Runestones allow you to travel vast distances across your world.  They are found on top of [Stone Circles]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/stone_circles) in the overworld, with 26 possible rune glyphs to discover.

## Runestone travel

Once you have found a runestone, throw an *ender pearl* at it.  After a moment, you will be transported to a new location corresponding to the runestone's destination.  By default, runestones will transport to the following structures and locations:

* your spawn point (the most common runestone)
* another stone circle
* a village
* a desert pyramid
* a pillager outpost
* a jungle temple
* a mineshaft
* a swamp hut
* an igloo
* an ocean ruin
* an underground ruin
* a big dungeon (if Quark is enabled and configured)

When you travel through a runestone, you will "learn" the glyph and its destination<sup>1</sup>.  Focusing the player's view on any runestone with this glyph in future will tell you the type of destination that the stone will transport you to.  Travelling through the same runestone again will always transport you to the same location it previously sent you to.

## Hints

* It is worth carrying extra ender pearls with you when you travel through a runestone.  If you get lost, you might be able to find another stone circle with a "spawn point" runestone.
* Runestones will be shuffled according to the world seed - you must rediscover a runestone's destination type when you start a new world!
