# Scrollkeepers

**Scrollkeepers** are villagers that sell [Scrolls]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/scrolls) and provide rewards for completed [Quests]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/quests).

Their "job site block" is the **Writing Desk**, crafted from four planks like a crafting table with two books above it.  Currently, the writing desk has no interaction.

Scrollkeepers only gain XP by completing quests for them.  They **do not gain XP when trading** with them.

## Buying scrolls

When a scrollkeeper is first employed (as a "novice" scrollkeeper) they will trade only "novice" (tier 1) scrolls, identified by a gray-colored scroll seal.  These scrolls provide the simplest quests.  Scrolls are traded for one or more emeralds.  Where a villager sells two scrolls with one at a higher price, the more expensive scroll will provide slightly harder quests with greater reward.

## Handing in quests

When you complete all the quest actions, return to the scrollkeeper.  They will have a green particle effect above their head if the quest is completed correctly.  Right-click them to "hand in" the quest and the following will happen:
* a toast message will appear saying "Quest Complete"
* a jingle will play
* you receive quest rewards
* the trade window will open

The following **might** happen, depending on the situation:
* the villager's XP will increase, possibly increasing their level
* a raid begins (normally this is rare - see below)

**NOTE**: When you accept a quest from a scroll sold by a particular scrollkeeper, you must return to the **same scrollkeeper** to hand in the quest.  If you find a scroll in the world somewhere, for example in dungeon loot, you can hand in the quest to **any scrollkeeper** to increase their XP.  

### Scrollkeeper XP increase

If the scrollkeeper has a level lower than "master", they are eligible for an XP increase when you hand in a quest.  If the XP increase hits the maximum for the scrollkeeper's current level, they will level up and offer you scrolls of a higher tier.

To increase the scrollkeeper's XP, you can hand in a quest of the **same tier** as the scrollkeeper - for example, an "expert" (green seal) scroll handed to an "expert" (emerald badge) scrollkeeper.

Handing in a quest of a **higher tier** - for example finding a "master" (blue seal) scroll in dungeon loot and handing to a "journeyman" (gold badge) scrollkeeper - will **significantly increase** the scrollkeeper's XP.

If you hand in a quest of a lower tier than the scrollkeeper they will not gain any XP.  You still receive quest rewards as normal.

Quests from scrolls with a **high value** have a chance to increase scrollkeeper XP by a larger amount.  Read more about scroll value on the [Scrolls]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/scrolls) page.

### Scrollkeeper death

If your scrollkeeper is killed while you are undertaking a quest from a scroll sold by the dead scrollkeeper, it is no longer possible to complete it.  You can abandon the quest by going to your inventory, clicking on the name of the quest and then "Quit".

Remember, it could take considerable effort and loyalty to increase the level of your scrollkeeper by completing quests for them, so try and protect them from harm!

### The raid

Illagers **don't want** scrollkeepers to level up to "master".  At the highest level, scrollkeepers offer you quests that reward you with a [Totem of Returning]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totem_of_returning) that teleports you to a distant [Stone Circle]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/stone_circles) - potentially giving you access to rare treasure.

As a result, there is a very small chance for a raid to begin every time you hand-in a quest to a villager of level **Journeyman or higher**.  The higher the level of the scrollkeeper, the greater the chance and ferocity of the incoming raid.
