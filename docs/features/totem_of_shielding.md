# Totem of Shielding

This orange totem grants protection against all damage types.  It has durability similar to the [Totem of Flying]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/totem_of_flying) and cannot be repaired.  It is obtainable via:
* A treasure chest in the [Vaults]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/vaults) (common)
* An [Illusioner]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/illusioners) drop (rare)

## Using the totem

This totem only grants protection when it is held in the **shield inventory slot**.  As you take damage, the totem will instead take a portion of the incoming hitpoints as durability damage.  When the durability is gone, the totem will be destroyed and you will take damage as normal.

Like the *Totem of Undying*, this totem will protect you from a single blow that causes more hitpoints than the totem has available, in which case the totem is immediately destroyed with no damage to the player.

## Trading
