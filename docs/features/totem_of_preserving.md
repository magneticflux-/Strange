# Totem of Preserving

This black totem preserves your current inventory items.  It is based on the *Totem of Holding* from Quark. 

## On death

When you die, a Totem of Preserving will be spawned close to your death location.  It has the **glowing effect** so it is visible through solid blocks and **never despawns**.  Picking up the totem adds it to your inventory and hovering over it shows you how many items it is holding.  Right-click to break the totem and retrieve your items.

If [Quark Oddities](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark-oddities) is present, this functionality will be automatically disabled.  It can be force-enabled via the `strange-common.toml` config file.

## In loot

Totems of Preserving may also be found within [Vaults]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/vaults).  These totems hold no items by default, so can be used to store your entire inventory when you choose by right-clicking while sneaking. Right-click again to break the totem and release the items.
