# Rune Portals

Rune Portals are portals constructed by a player that allow immediate transport to a location in the world.  The order of the glyphs in the portal matches that of a location in the Overworld recorded in a [Travel Journal]({{site.baseurl}}/features/travel_journal).  When a portal is constructed, a player can ignite the portal using a **Quark colored rune**.  

## Getting co-ordinates

Every location entry created in a [Travel Journal]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/travel_journal) comes with a unique set of glyphs that describe the entry's position in the Overworld.  At first, these glpyhs will be unknown and will appear as question marks.  By travelling through [Runestones]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/runestones), you "learn" glyphs.  Learned glyphs then appear as part of the set of glyphs for the location in the journal.

When you have discovered all the required runestone glyphs (there are no more question marks) you may build a rune portal that exactly matches the order of glyphs in the journal.

## Getting Rune Portal blocks

As you travel throughout **The End** you will find [Geodes]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/geodes).  These geodes may contain [Raw Amethyst]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/amethyst).  Using a pickaxe, you can mine amethyst from the geodes and use it on a crafting table or stonecutter to create **Polished Amethyst**.  Polished Amethyst may then be used on a stonecutter to create **Runic Amethyst** with 1 or 26 runes carved into it.  These carved rune blocks can then be used to craft a portal.

## Building and using Rune Portals

Once you have 12 Runic Amethyst blocks that exactly match the runes from your [Travel Journal]({{site.baseurl}}/features/travel_journal) entry, you can build a portal.  The portal must **precisely match** the order in the journal.  When finished, right click on the bottom middle block of the portal with a **Quark colored rune** to open the portal.  Stepping through the open portal will transport you immediately to the location descibed in your journal.  There is no limit to the number of times you may travel.

## Warning!

You must match the glyphs of the portal in exactly the same order as the glyphs in the journal.  Getting even one glyph wrong will cause the portal to explode when you try and open it!
