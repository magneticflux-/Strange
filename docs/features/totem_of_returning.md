# Totem of Returning

This purple totem is a single-use teleporter and is obtainable via:
* A treasure chest in the [Vaults]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/vaults) (common)
* An [Illusioner]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/illusioners) drop (rare)
* Reward for a Tier 5 (diamond) [Quest]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/scrollkeeper), bound to a distant [Stone Circle]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/stone_circles)

## Location binding

An unbound totem does not do anything when activated.  To **bind a location**, sneak-right-click on a block that you want to return to.  The totem will then have the enchantment glint effect and hovering over it will show you the bound co-ordinates.  When you activate the bound totem, you will be teleported to the bound location and the totem will be destroyed.

You may right-click while sneaking with a bound totem to re-bind it to a different location. 

## Activating a pre-bound totem

Some [Quests]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/quests) provide a pre-bound totem as a reward.  These totems may take you to a distant [Stone Circle]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/stone_circle) in [The Outerlands]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/outerlands) and therefore help you locate the underground [Vaults]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/vaults).

## Using a totem with a travel journal

If you have a Totem of Returning in your inventory while you are looking at a [Travel Journal]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/travel_journal), a small icon of the totem will appear on all journal entries.  You may click this icon to teleport yourself instantly to the travel journal location, consuming the totem in the process.

## Trading

[Scrollkeepers]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/scrollkeepers) in [The Outerlands]({{ site.baseurl }}/features/outerlands) may trade Totems of Returning for emeralds.
