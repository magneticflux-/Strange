## Installation
This mod requires [Forge for Minecraft 1.15.2](https://files.minecraftforge.net/) (at least version **31.2.0**) and [Charm for Minecraft 1.15.2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/charm) (version **1.5.9+**) as dependencies.

**BETA WARNING!** *Strange* is currently in beta.  It may break your world, your game, your cats, it might not play well with other mods etc.

If you are upgrading from a previous beta, please note that there **may be item registration warnings**.  This is because some features are changing quite a lot between beta versions.  Such warnings are not themselves a problem, but you may find erratic behavior in your world.

Please get in touch via the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/svenhjol/Strange/issues) if Strange is causing game-breaking issues.

## Quark compatibility

*Strange* is designed to play nicely with [Quark](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark). If Quark is present then extra Quark-specific quests,
decoration and integration will be available.
