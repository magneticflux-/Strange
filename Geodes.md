# Geodes

Geodes spawn around the larger End Islands.  They have random sizes and spheroid shapes.
Geodes are hollow.  They generate an outer shell of End Stone and an inner shell of variable material.

There are currently three types of geode planned for inclusion:

## 1. "Moonstone" geode
This geode generates with **Moonstones** in the inner shell (see Moonstones below).

## 2. "Amethyst" geode
This geode generates with **Raw Amethyst** and obsidian in the inner shell (see Amethyst below).

## 3. "Portal" geode
This geode generates with obsidian, and in the center of the geode, a portal block surrounded by bedrock platforms (like the End Island portals).  Throw an ender pearl at the portal block to teleport to an **End Dungeon** (see End Dungeons below).


## Moonstones
Moonstones are a variable-colored translucent glass-based block that emit light level 11.  They drop themselves when mined with a pickaxe.  As of 20200526 they have no purpose other than decoration.

## Amethyst
Amethyst is a dark purple block that can be crafted or used on a stonecutter to make Polished Amethyst, Amethyst Slabs, Amethyst Stairs etc.

Polished Amethyst can be further crafted in a stonecutter into Runic Amethyst.

### Runic Amethyst
Runic Amethyst is obtained by using Polished Amethyst on a stonecutter.  It has 26 variants, one for each letter in the Standard Galactic Alphabet.  Runic Amethyst is used to create a Rune Portal by building a vertical portal structure with 12 blocks.  It can be turned back into Polished Amethyst on a crafting table.

## End Dungeon
Generates within the larger End Islands and consists of one or more rooms.  It uses the jigsaw manager to create random structures in a similar manner to Underground Ruins.
