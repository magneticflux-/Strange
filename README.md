# Strange

A Charm add-on, bringing adventure and exploration.

## Q&A

### Long time since update
Strange has been rewritten from the ground up for Fabric in 1.16.  If you check the commit history, you should see that the project is not idle.  However, the 1.14 version will no longer be developed.  There *might* be a Forge version of Strange in future, but that will only be when it's complete.

### Stuff doesn't work like it used to
Some things like the "outerlands" and the "rune portals" have gone away and almost certainly won't be coming back.  That's because when I playtested them, I didn't like them.  There are alternatives to these features such as the Runic Altar and the Vaults ruins are now available to play much closer to home.  More specific information will be added to the wiki when time permits

### Scrollkeepers don't accept quests
If you buy a scroll from a scrollkeeper and complete it, you can complete it by right-clicking the scroll on the scrollkeeper you purchased it from.  They will throw you the reward items.  If it's a treasure scroll you can hand it in to any scrollkeeper (by right-clicking).
